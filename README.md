Histogram Equalization, Thresholding, Edge Detection, Data Augmentation and Morphological Operations

## Histogram Equalization:
Read the image in grayscale -> Compute histogram -> Compute cumulative distribution frequency (CDF) -> Normalize CDF -> Map old pixel values to knew -> Output original image and equalized image

## Edge Detection
Read the image in grayscale -> Apply Gaussian Blur to reduce noise -> Detect edges using Canny edge detection -> Display the original image and the edge-detected image side by side
