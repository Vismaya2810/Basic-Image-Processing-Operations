Histogram Equalization, Thresholding, Edge Detection, Data Augmentation and Morphological Operations

## Histogram Equalization:
Read the image in grayscale -> Compute histogram -> Compute cumulative distribution frequency (CDF) -> Normalize CDF -> Map old pixel values to knew -> Output original image and equalized image
